# Sahra Soliman's Digital Portfolio 

## About Me 
Welcome to my digital portfolio! My name is Sahra Solimann and I am an IT major at UCF graduating in Spring 2025. My goal is to work in a technical field and gain technical hands-on skills as well as leadership experience. I have experience in coding languages such as Java and C, as well as knowledge in databases using mySQL. I am able to easily adapt to situations and determine the best way to move forward. I also have experience working in teams.
I have previously worked at Target mainly stocking shelves and occasionally working the register. I also volunteered at Give Kids the World, where I learned communication skills with customers and staff.
