# Wayback Analysis

## YouTube, 2006
![YouTube Picture](youtube2006.png)

YouTube in 2006 was extremely cluttered. Listed at the top are the menu options, such as Home and Channels, similar to modern websites, however, the content underneath does not follow these modern standards.

Videos are lined up from top to bottom on the home page and displays the date added, description, and even the tags the video was uploaded under. Comparing this to modern YouTube, the details that YouTube includes in the browsing menu seem unnecessary to me and are not pleasing to the eye. There is too much information for a preview of a video.

To the right is the Member Login, which is strange to have as a sidebar on a website.
I also noticed that when you scroll, the menus at the top disappear, meaning you must scroll back up to navigate to another menu. 

In modern websites we expect previews of these videos and content to be simple and concise, and clicking reveals further information to the user. It is a standard that information that the typical user does not care about is hidden until clicked on. This creates a minimalist look for the site and is easy on the eyes. We also expect login pages to be their own separate page, not a sidebar on the home menu. It is very jarring because after years of websites following the same formula, seeing this type of formatting for a now very well known website is strange. 

Although this site would not pass in today's standards, visiting YouTube in 2006 felt like opening a time capsule. It is very cool to see a website that is now worth billions back when it was first starting out.

# Quick Start Guide

## Assignment Rationale 
This assignment will let you experiment with a generative AI tool of your choice, and you will strengthen your critical thinking skills as you evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.

## Where to Start
Think of a product that you already know how to use. It can be a bluetooth headset, an app, a video game, a sewing machine, or anything that requires a little bit of setup to use.

## Assignment Steps
This assignment is a little more structured than others in our course, so please follow these steps:
1. Open Copilot or any other text-based generative AI tool you prefer (don't pay for it unless you happen to already have a subscription)
2. Write a prompt that asks it to generate a quick-start guide for your product of choice. (copy and paste this somewhere - it is part of what you need to turn in)
3. Evaluate the output. Try to follow the steps yourself, or at least imagine following them.
4. Prompt it again (and again) if needed (again saving your prompts somewhere).
5. Reflect on the process and write a short (200 words) reflection on the tool's strengths, weaknesses, and anything that you learned (or anything that surprised you).

## What is Due
On your portfolio, post the following:
-The name of the tool (with the link if you have it)
-Your prompts
-The best output 
-Your reflection
